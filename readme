This project contains source code for Dataset preprocessing, Model, Testing and some utilization used in Adversarial Domain Separation and Adaptation(ADSA).
We use Python2 and run on Ubunto, we also use the following library: tensorflow(0.12), matplotlib, scikit-learn(optional).
Please make sure you already install these library before runing the project.

We first breiefly describe the content of each folder. For detail, please see the Readme.txt in each folder.

Please download from the provider website.
Amazon Reviews : https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~mdredze/datasets/sentiment/ (please download the processed_acl.tar.gz)

Folder-Model:
Here contains code for model construction.
For the proposed model, we have
Adversarial Domain Separation and Adaptation


!! Before run the code, please change the path of dataset file and the path of Folder Model in the following codes: every testing codes, XXFeaturePlot.py and DataPackage.py in Amazon_Reviews.
And create Folder named "Experimental_Result" at each folders of experiments
